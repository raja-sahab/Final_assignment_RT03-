function functionCallback:
   it is for the base_scan subscriber
   if
     is_active=true
     Copies the ranges values in the base_scan message into an array
     Calls the function scanSector to fill the sectors array
   else if
     function logic can take decision, call it
   else
     call function integral_logic

function scanSectors:
   to search for the closest obstacle in each sector
   If it finds a closest obstacle, than update the sectors array
   
function logic:
   It makes choices based on the values into the sectors array
   if
     front sector is free
     look for front-right and front-left sector to allign with path
   else if
     obstacle is on front
     then search left and right sectors respectively to find obstacle-free path and move accordingly
   else
     no sector is obstacle free then return 0
     
function integral_logic:
   Function to decide where to go when there are obstales all around the robot
   if
     right-area is greater than left area
     turn right
   else
     turn left

function integral
   Function to perform a discrete integral with the trapezium method
   while
      l is less than end
      use formula
      return result
      
function drive
   Function to drive the robot, 
   filling the geometry message and publishing it on the topic cmd_vel
   
function server_response
   it sets the speed of the motor depending on the message
   if
     input is 's' decrease linear-speed by 0.1
   else if 
     input is 'w' increase linear-speed by 0.1
   else if 
     input is 'x' reset linear-speed to 0.0
   else if 
     input is 'z' reset angular-speed to 0.0
   else if 
     input is 'd' decrease angular-speed by 0.1
   else if 
     input is 'a' increase angular-speed by 0.1
   else if
     input is '0' is_active=true
   else if
     input is '1' is_active=false
     
function main
   initialize driver_assistance node
   intialize values of global-variables
     speed=0.0
     d_br=1.2
   subscribe to the topic base_scan
   create a service for keyboard input to control the robot
   Creates a publisher to the cmd_vel topic for real-time controlling
   return 0
